# 🏠+🧪 = Homelab

## Intro

I really enjoy using my homelab as a way to learn and have fun! As a Senior Solutions Architect, I get to work with a fantastic mix of technologies like AWS, Azure, Terraform, and Kubernetes every day. My homelab is like my personal playground where I can safely experiment and dive into new tech through different projects. It’s a great way to enhance my skills while having a blast!
